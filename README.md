## Project Description
In this capstone project, I designed and built a micro-services based application that leverages modern web technologies to create a dynamic and user-friendly experience. This project demonstrates my ability to handle both the front-end and back-end aspects of web development, including the use of containerization and orchestration tools for deployment.

## Features
- Dynamic user interface built with REACT
- Robust back-end services using Python and Django
- Data management with MongoDB
- Authentication and user management
- Continuous integration and deployment with GitHub Actions
- Containerized application with Docker and Kubernetes

## Technologies Used
- **Front-End**: REACT
- **Back-End**: Python, Django
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
